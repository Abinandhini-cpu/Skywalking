# Welcome
**SkyWalking 6 documents and codes are still on building, Status: WIP. Of course, we welcome everyone to join us.**

From here you can learn all about **SkyWalking**’s architecture, how to deploy and use SkyWalking and 
resources related to the project.

several ways to provide observability, including monitoring and alarm of course.
