# Marketplace

**Marketplace** is the first UI menu on the SkyWalking native UI. It is the place where you can install and manage SkyWalking
native and 3rd-party components. 
The native out-of-box features are listed in the marketplace. Follow the `Documentation` guidance to set up required components.
Once the services of those layers are detected by SkyWalking, the relative menu will show up on the left automatically.
