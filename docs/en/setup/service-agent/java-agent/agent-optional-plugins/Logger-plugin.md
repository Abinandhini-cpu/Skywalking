# Overview

`logger-plugin` can store the logs generated by the program during the call, such as the content of the error log, into the span log.  Through the configuration file, you can control the log source (log4j2, logback, log4j), package name, and level.

# Configuration file

By default, the configuration file is in `apache-skywalking-apm-bin/agent/config//logger-plugin/logconfig.properties`.Of course, **If the file does not exist, the configuration will still be configured with the following default values:**

```properties
log4j.packages=*
log4j.level=error
log4j2.packages=*
log4j2.level=error
logback.packages=*
logback.level=error
```

The meaning of the above configuration is as follows:

1. It will process information from all logging systems, including `log4j`, `log4j2`, `logback`.
2. Only the log information of the `error` level will be processed, and the log information lower than the `error` level will be ignored, including `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`.
3. It will match all packages.

# Field description

## packages

**package attribute**: Specify the package name of the log that needs log conversion.  **The default value is `*` , and it will match all packages.**

packages value:

* the name of package, eg: `org.apache.skywalking`
* `*`:match all 

**Notice:**

When matching multiple packages, the names of different packages should be separated by commas.

## level

**level attribute** : The level of the log for conversion. **By default it is `error` level**.

The specific sequence of log levels from low to high is as follows:

`trace` < `debug` < `info` <`warn`< `error` < `fatal`

**Notice:**

Because `logback` not support `fatal`, it will be an exception if you set **logback.level=fatal**.
