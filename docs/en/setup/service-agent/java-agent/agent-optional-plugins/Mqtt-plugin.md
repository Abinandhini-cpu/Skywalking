## Support mqtt3.X
Here is an optional plugin `apm-mqtt-3.x-plugin`

## Introduce
- Note! ! ! Because the mqtt header cannot be expanded, the producer cannot set the skywalking `Contextcarrier` header in the push message header, which will cause the call chain of the producer and the consumer to be broken. But it does not affect your tracking.
- Copy `apm-mqtt-3.x-plugin.jar` to `agent/plugins`, restarting the `agent` can effect the plugin.
