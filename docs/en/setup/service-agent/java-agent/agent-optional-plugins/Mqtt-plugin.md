## Support mqtt3.X
Here is an optional plugin `apm-mqtt-3.x-plugin`

## Introduce
The Mqtt header cannot be expanded, and the Agent access requires attention
### Notice:
- Agent access sequence, consumer first, producer second, is very important!!!
- Copy `apm-mqtt-3.x-plugin.jar` to `agent/plugins`, restarting the `agent` can effect the plugin.
