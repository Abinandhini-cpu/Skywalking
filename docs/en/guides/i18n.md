# Guide
> This section explains how to manage translations for internationalization of menu items.

SkyWalking UI's internationalization translations are in the [src/locales/lang](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-booster-ui/tree/main/src/locales/lang). And the translations for the menu items are in [src/locales/lang/menus](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-booster-ui/tree/main/src/locales/lang/menus), including `label` and `description`. The translation key of `label` which is the value of `i18nKey` is from `oap-server/server-starter/src/main/resources/ui-initialized-templates/menu.yaml`. The translation key of `description` consists of the `i18nKey` value and `_desc`. The `description` contents will be displayed on the Marketplace page. For example,
```json
{
  "general_service": "General Service",
  "general_service_desc": "Observe services and relative direct dependencies through telemetry data collected from SkyWalking Agents."
}
```
