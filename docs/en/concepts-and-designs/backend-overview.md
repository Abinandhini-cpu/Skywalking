# Observability Analysis Platform
SkyWalking OAP and UI provides dozens of features to support observability analysis for your services, cloud infrastructure, open-source components, and more.

Besides those out-of-box features for monitoring, users could leverage the powerful and flexible analysis language to build their own analysis and visualization.

There are 3 powerful and native language engines designed to analyze observability data from the above areas.
1. [Observability Analysis Language](oal.md) processes native traces and service mesh data.
1. [Meter Analysis Language](mal.md) is responsible for metrics calculation for native meter data, and adopts a stable and widely used metrics system, such as Prometheus and OpenTelemetry.
1. [Log Analysis Language](lal.md) focuses on log contents and collaborate with Meter Analysis Language.

SkyWalking community is willing to accept your monitoring extension powered by these languages, if the monitoring is public and general usable.
