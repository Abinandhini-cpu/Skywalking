# Define the hierarchy of service layers, the layers under the specific layer are related lower of the layer.
# The relation could have a matching rule for auto matching, which are defined in the `auto-matching-rules` section.
# All the layers are defined in the file `org.apache.skywalking.oap.server.core.analysis.Layers.java`.

# Use Groovy script to define the matching rules, the input parameters are the upper service(u) and the lower service(l) and the return value is a boolean.
# which are used to match the relation between the upper service(u) and the lower service(l) on the different layers.

  # the name of the upper service is equal to the name of the lower service
  name: "{ (u, l) -> u.name == l.name }"
  # the short name of the upper service is equal to the short name of the lower service
